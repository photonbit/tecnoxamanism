# Teknoxamanism

Because neither technology, nor magic will save us.

To use the machine, disguise it and put it to the service of the collective.

To aid the raise of self and collective consciousness.

To allow and enforce choosing the depth of knowledge.

## The game

At first, it is a personal experimentation and puzzle game.

You can have the avatar of a Spirit in your hands: on the upper part of the spirit, its face.
On the bottom part: a rune that will represent or give tips of the movement that is required
to summon or awaken the spirit.

Later, it becomes a group experimentation and performing game.

After each holder have learnt how to summon the different Spirits, we start listening and paying
attention to happens when two of them are activated at the same time, and if the same thing
happens when they are activated again together for the second time. Maybe when all of them are
activated, or if they are activated in certain order, we can hear the music of the Spheres.

Perhaps, at some moment, it evolves into a tool for subtle group awareness and communication
(fast-forward experimentation idea: by including the function interpolated from the exponentiation
of distance of the real movements compared with the summoning function as almost non-noticeable 
filters to the music and sounds present at the moment).


## Device Programming

- BLE UART Service
- Send timestamp + Orientation Quaternions

## Spiritual Entities

Each Spirit will have a Summoning Function and a Manifestation Function.

### Summoning Function

We calculate the derivative of the summoning function, 
and we start measuring in the origin of coordinates.
If the following values are inside a defined accuracy range of that derivative,
we are progressing in the invocation and the values of the original summoning
function are sent to the Manifestation Function.

If a number of consecutive values do not comply within
the required validity range of the derivative function,
the time axis origin of coordinates is reset.

A Spirit might require a slow and constant acceleration change
to continue operating, while another one will only accept
rapid shaking movements oscillating between positive and negative values.

### Manifestation Function

This function will take the values of the Summoning Function as input 
and will send over the result as OSC commands to the Channelling Portal.

A Spirit might require a slow and constant Summoning Function 
and have an intense and strong Manifestation Function.

## Channelling Portal

The entrance hall to the music generation,
being the latter not directly part of the Storytelling Project,
as the Channelling Portal will have the form of an LV2 plugin
that could be directly applied to a track or effect in another plugin.

# Sound invocation sequences

## Instrument spirits

### Activation sound

### Sustain music and interactions

Each spirit has a song that will be played when the spirit sustain music
is activated and none of the other spirits is in a state to be activated.

And a graph of possibilities of interactions with other spirits.

The process of finding the song for each combination it is also a social
game that we can play.

Contrary to my previous idea, while doing tests with the activation sound
of the spirit of the thunder, the song that I found for the spirit of the
thunder is calm: "Into the Dark Blue", by Joep Beving.

The sustain music is activated after 10 seconds of interrupted 
successful summoning pattern detection, if it is not activated
before by other spirits. After 10 seconds, it will turn into
activation mode.

After 7 seconds of interrupted successful summoning pattern detection,
the spirit will pass to be in acceptance mode.

A spirit will be summoned if it is in acceptance mode and another spirit
is in activation mode.
